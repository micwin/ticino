event inheritance

    say we have a general event containing logic and data common to all of your events, ...
    
+--------------------------------
class GeneralEvent {
	// some general stuff
}
+--------------------------------

	... an event containing data for a specific use case and extending GeneralEvent, ...

+--------------------------------
class SpecificEvent extends GeneralEvent {
	// some use case specific data
}
+--------------------------------

    ... a receiver triggered by the general event, ...
    
+--------------------------------
class Receiver {
    public void receive(GeneralEvent event) {
        System.out.println("got event of " + event.getClass());
    }
}
+--------------------------------

    ... some main method bringing event and receiver together (normally you would do that in a spring context) ...
    
+--------------------------------
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Ticino.register(GeneralEvent.class, new Receiver());
}
+--------------------------------

    ... then you could dispatch a specific event like that ...
    
+--------------------------------
// fire specific event
    Specific event evt = new SpecificEvent();
    Ticino.dispatch(evt);
+--------------------------------

    ... and finally get an output like that :

+--------------------------------    
got event of class net.micwin.examples.inheritance.Main$SpecificEvent
+--------------------------------

migration : general approach 

  being reflection based instead of subclassing and annotating, there is a big migration path from or to ticino.
  Lets demonstrate the migration in case of wicket - which runs nearly out-of-the-box:
  
+--------------------------------
public class WicketApplication extends WebApplication {

  @Override
  public void onEvent(IEvent<MyPayLoad> event) {
	// keep the wicket way functioning
	super.onEvent(event);
	
	// but also support strict typed ticino event handling
	Ticino.dispatch (event.getPayload()) ;
  }
}
+--------------------------------
   
   Somewhere else...
   
+--------------------------------
public class NoSink {
   
   public NoSink () {
     Ticino.register (MyPayLoad.class , this) ; 
   }
   
   public void blablah (MyPayLoad payload) {
     // doSomething meaningful
   }
   
}
+--------------------------------

    Note that you dont have to unregister - ticino does this for you if the receiver gets gc'ed.
