# Welcome to the ticino modules!

the ticino modules is a collection of java libraries. 

Each one adresses a very specialized problem every java developer sooner or later comes around.

While focus is  prime directive, the other prime directives are simplicity and small binaries. 

ticino proves this to be possible for a small subset of java problems.
