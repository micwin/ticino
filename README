ticino is a lightweight stand-alone event framework.

The core libraries only consist of 2 class files and is only of size of approx. 8 kb (debug info included).

To use ticino, there is no class to extend, nor an interface to implement, nor an annotation to use. 
In fact, to receive ticino events along with spring, you dont have to change any code at all.

Please see http://ticino.micwin.net for documentation and coding examples.
